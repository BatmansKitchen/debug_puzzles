# System Debugging Puzzles

This repo contains puzzles for debugging systems. Generally, the puzzles
will mutate the host machine, and it will be up to the user to fix the
mutation. The puzzles each will give a clear victory condition to tell
if you have won or not.

## Set up

Run `./deploy.sh` as root on your machine.

## Problem format

Read the **README.md** for the problem statement. If you're done or
stuck and give up (scrub), then read the **ANSWER.md** file to get an
explanation of the answer. You can run the problem through the
**run.sh** or **run.bat** script in the problem directory.

**WARNING: DO NOT RUN THESE ON YOUR PERSONAL MACHINE, RUN THEM IN
VIRTUAL MACHINES OR HOSTS THAT YOU DO NOT CARE ABOUT AT ALL**.
